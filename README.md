# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
### Introduction:
      Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health
    care crisis.
      Diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase level of blood
    glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination,
    increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading cause of
    blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke. When we eat,
    our body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas is
    supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a key to open our cells, to allow
    the glucose to enter and allow us to use the glucose for energy. But with
    diabetes, this system does not work. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most
    common forms of the disease, but there are also other kinds, such as gestational
    diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, as well as other forms. Machine
    learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in
    which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a
    system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a
    higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning
    techniques.
